Extract. Transform, Load

Create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs

## Step 1:
In Step 1, create a function to read in the three files and give it a name.
In Step 2, read in the Kaggle metadata and MovieLens ratings CSV files as Pandas DataFrames.
In Step 3, open the Wikipedia JSON file and use the json.load() function to convert the JSON data to raw data.
In Step 4, read in the raw Wikipedia movie data as a Pandas DataFrame.
In Step 5, use the code provided to return the three DataFrames.
In Step 6, use the variables provided to create a path to the Wikipedia data, the Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data files.
In Step 7, set the three variables in Step 6 equal to the function created in Step 1.
In Step 8, set the DataFrames from the return statement equal to the file names in Step 6. In this step, you are reassigning the variables created in Step 6 to the variables in the return statement.
In Steps 9-11, check that all three files are converted to a DataFrame. See the images below for confirmation:
The wiki_movies_df DataFrame
